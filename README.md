# Bitwig-Theme-Editor Helper
Helps you change the colours in a json file used by the [Bitwig Theme Editor](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor). You can [use it in the Browser here](https://polarity.github.io/bitwig-theme-editor-helper/main.html)

- extract the current colours with the [Bitwig Theme Editor](https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor)
- copy the contents of bitwig-window-theme.json / bitwig-arranger-theme.json in to the text area
- click extract
- change the colors with the slider
- click apply
- copy the json data from the text area back into your json file
- patch the jar

(I think patching the JAR ob Bitwig is against TOS, be aware.)
